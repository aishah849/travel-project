          <h2>Why Singapore?</h2>
          <h3>Singapore, The Lion City</h3>
          <p>In the 14th century, a Sumatran prince spotted an auspicious beast upon landing on an island after a thunderstorm, which he was told was a 'lion'. Thus, the name Singapore comes from the Malay words “Singa” for lion and “Pura” for city. The island became the site of a Malay fishing village and inhabited by several hundred indigenous Orang Laut.</p>
          <p>In 1822, ethnic residential areas were segregated into four areas. The European Town had residents made up of European traders, Eurasians and rich Asians, while the ethnic Chinese were located in present-day Chinatown and south-east of the Singapore River. Ethnic Indians resided at Chulia Kampong north of Chinatown, and Kampong Gelam consisted of Muslims, ethnic Malays and Arabs.</p>
          <p>Today, many slices of Singapore’s multi-cultural, colonial and wartime past are preserved in and around the city. You can visit monuments, museums and memorials, or for a real trip through time, take a walk along a heritage trail.</p>
